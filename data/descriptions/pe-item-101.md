*   First of all we have the **New Template**

*   Which is used to upgrade netherite equipment.

**Here is an example**

It's simple, just like the original upgrades, it can be found in **bastion chests**, and then, **duplicated.**

*   Now that you have the templates you can improve your netherite equipment, gaining a special effect that increases along with the armor.

● **Helmet:** Health Boost 💓

**● Chest**: Strength 🔥

**● Pants:** Resistence 🔩

**● Boots:** Speed 🐇

*   Armor pieces go up to **level 5** (with the exception of boots which only have 2 levels).

*   This addon does **not require any experimental features** and is updated to **1.21.21+**
*   (it should also work perfectly with versions 1.20 and 1.19, although I haven't tested it)

![Image 17](https://r2.mcpedl.com/submissions/224956/images/skill-equipments-v2_8.png) I recommend you use this addon with the "[**Better Enchant Description**](https://mcpedl.com/better-enchant-description/)" texture I created, then your look will look like this:
